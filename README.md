to install, drag `/payload/` into ur custom folder or merge it with ur huds folder

if you want the font(Nimbus Sans L) that comes with this by default, and put `#base "payloadscheme.res"` as the first line in your `clientscheme.res` file

if you dont, you can delete the `/fonts/` folder, as well as `/resource/payloadscheme.res` -- just make sure to replace all instances of `juliaSmall` in `resource/ui/objectivestatusescort.res` with ur own font
